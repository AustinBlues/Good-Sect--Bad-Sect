# Good Intersection - Bad Intersection

This is a mobile Web application for bicyclists to report good and bad
intersection for cyclists and other locations of interest: bike shops,
stolen bikes, roadway hazards, etc.

This fork of https://github.com/philipkd/Good-Sect--Bad-Sect builds on
the work of the February 25, 2012 Code for America ATX Hackathon
(http://codeatx.wikispaces.com/).

So far the major changes are dates on the popups (click on a marker).
Another project is populating the application with bike thefts during
the last month from the Austin Police Department's Incident data.
